# color_guess_game
This is a small practice project to get you guys into writing more of your own React code. The requirements are simple:
Create three buttons and a colored square, like the attached screenshot.
The color of the square should be randomly generated, and the hex code text for that color should be on a random one of the three buttons. The other two buttons should have random codes that are not related to the color of the square.
The goal for the user experience is for the user to guess which hex code is the right color of the square. If they choose the right one, some text bellow the buttons should show and say some thing like "Correct!", and if they choose wrong then it should say something like "Incorrect". Whether the user is right or wrong, the app should randomly generate a new color for the square and hex codes for the buttons so that the user can guess again.
